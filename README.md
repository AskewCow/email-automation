Python Email Automation Script

## Version 1

This initial version was used for sending around 60 emails to different contacts with small personalisations in each email.
This version used:
- Excel File: for contact addresses and names
- HTML File: for the email template

## Version 2

This version was updated to use JSON file rather than an excel file. Nothing particularly wrong with the previous version but email list was provided in a different format this time.
This version used:
- JSON File: for contact addresses and university names
- HTML File: for the email template
